# Chatter Rollout Strategy

  1. It is critical to develop a Chatter rollout strategy
 
  2. Identify key people to be Chatter champions

    * Executive Sponsor - This person must believe in the power of social collaboration and Chatter. They must be willing to invest time to make Chatter collaboration a success

    * Evangelist - people at your company who have incredible knowledge and already love social collaboration. Your evangelists can help answer questions, encourage other users who are nervous about posting, create and manage groups, and curate content.

    * Community Manager - You need a Community Manager curating quality content and driving user engagement. Examples of great content include helpful files, links to industry news articles or videos, and posts about events or exciting announcements at your company. 
 
  3. A great Chatter rollout needs a solid communication plan. 

    * Create marketing content - ou can send drip emails and videos to advertise that Chatter is coming. Consider allocating budget for fun swag or a launch party with cake and balloons

    * Create a schedule - Choose your launch date carefully. Avoid busy times for your company (for example, the last day of the sales month) and holidays. It’s a general best practice to turn on Chatter after hours. Once you’ve decided on your launch date, create a schedule for your pre-launch communication.

  3. Chat ettiquite - Consider putting together a simple list of guidelines for user behavior. Publish the list and share it with your users. Post it in a public place, like an All Company Chatter group.

    * Put mentions in comments. Placing mentions in comments prevents anyone or any group that’s mentioned from getting notified repeatedly whenever there’s action on the post.

    * Use mentions thoughtfully. You can make every name you enter a mention, but it counts most when a mention triggers a less-frequent and more meaningful notification. 

    * Make mentions count. Where your post lives can impact whether the person or group you mention is notified or has access to the post. Check out the following table for examples.

# Identify Use Cases

  1. An All-Hands Chatter group for company-wide collaboration during quarterly or annual company calls. If your teams are geographically distributed or you have remote employees, an all-hands group is especially important.

  2. A #CorporateGoals Chatter topic to highlight and share around a key company objective. If your company decides it’s the year for giving back, make giving back a topic (#givingback). Encourage your employees to share how they’re giving back in Chatter, and advise them to mark those posts with #givingback. Topics can promote company-wide collaboration and the visibility of company objectives (#CorporateGoals).

  3. A series of quick polls to gauge employee reaction to a planned product enhancement. If you’re looking to get fast feedback while you iterate, consider informal polling in Chatter. Collect insights from your employees with a quick, one-question poll, and draw your employees’ attention to the poll by @mentioning groups and users.

  4. A Competitive Strategy Chatter group where you can share insights on your competitors, access files and tip sheets, and get quick answers from experts.

  5. An Event Planning Chatter group where you can collaborate while planning a department event. Collaborate on the slides for the event, schedule speakers, share details on the agenda. Even invite external vendors who could be supplying food, drinks, or equipment to coordinate all the details.

  3. Measure Results

    * Once you’re live, you can track your results. Download Chatter Usage Dashboards from AppExchange. You can also download the Chatter Challenge Dashboard to monitor Chatter group and following activity.

    * Your Community Manager can use these dashboards to monitor the overall health of your Chatter adoption. Your Community Manager can also conduct surveys, either using Chatter polls or through focus groups, to gauge the response to Chatter and prioritize future work.

# Profile-Based Chatter Rollout Overview

  1. Profile-based rollout of Chatter enables Chatter for a subset of users instead of all users in the organization.

  2. A Chatter profile-based rollout makes Chatter available for a part of your organization, but not for all users. Once profile-based rollout is enabled for your organization, you can turn enable Chatter for the users with the required user profile or permission sets. All other users in your organization don’t have access to Chatter.
