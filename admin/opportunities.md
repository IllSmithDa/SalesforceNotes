# Opportunities

  1. Opportunities are deals in progress. In Salesforce, you can create opportunities for existing accounts or by converting a qualified lead.

  2. Opportunities process can be customized to fit client needs 

  3. Stage history tab - records stages within opportunites it has been through

  4. Only one account can be associated with one opportunity but can be associated with multiple contacts

# Opportunity Stages - If you’ve worked in sales, you know that deals usually progress from tentative to firm before they’re finalized. As a deal progresses, you grow more confident that you’ll make the sale

  1. Prospecting

  2. Proposal/Price Quote

  3. Negotiation/Review

  4. Closed/Won

  5. Closed/Lost 

# Contact Roles on Opportunities

  1. Contact roles for opportunities tell you which contacts you’re dealing with for the opportunity, and how each is related to the opportunity. You can also link contacts from other accounts to the opportunity using contact roles.

# Sell as a Team

  1. It often takes a team to close a deal. In Salesforce, adding an opportunity team helps team members work together and track the opportunity’s progress.

  2. Opportunity teams are a bit like account teams. Both allow you to relate particular people at your company to accounts or opportunities. 

    * But where account team members can be expected to form a long-term relationship with the customer, an opportunity team is a temporary group composed of people who can help you close the deal.

    * Being a part of the opportunity team gives the team members special visibility into the opportunity, such as updates on Chatter. 

    * If you often work with the same coworkers on your opportunities, you can create a default opportunity team and automatically add that team to all new opportunities. It makes setting up the sales team for your opportunities fast and easy.
