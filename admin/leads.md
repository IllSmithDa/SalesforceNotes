# Leads

  1. Leads are people and companies that you’ve identified as potential customers. 
  
  2. You find leads in a number of ways. Many of your leads can be referred to you by other happy customers. You can also gather leads when customers contact you on your website, stop by your booth at a conference, or through information exchanges with partner companies. In Salesforce, information about leads is stored in Lead records.

  3. Not all companies use leads. Some companies work their entire pipeline as opportunities, segmenting deals into unqualified and qualified groupings. 
  
    * But there are some big advantages to using leads. 
      
      - You can better track, report on, and target marketing campaigns to prospective customers. 
      
      - Leads can help you concentrate on the potential deals most likely to close. 
      
      - If your company has separate sales teams for prospective customers and existing customers, using leads helps everyone work more efficiently.
      
# Dive Into the Lead Record

  1. If the lead is involved in any marketing campaigns, they are listed in the Campaign History for the lead.

  2. Review the lead’s Details tab to find and update information about the lead.

  3. Use the lead’s Activity tab to log your calls and emails to help you remember what you talked about and how the lead responded. 
  
    * Plan for the future by creating Tasks or Events.

  4. Use the lead’s News tab to check the latest news for the lead’s industry. 
    
    * Sign in with your Twitter account to find and follow the lead’s Twitter feed.

  5. Connect with you coworkers to ask questions, seek advice, or provide information on the lead’s Chatter tab. 
  
    * The Chatter feed for the record also shows when you create activities. 

  6. The lead’s status is an important indicator that helps you track where each lead is in your sales process. 
  
    * The traditional way to update a lead’s status is to click Edit while viewing the lead’s record, change the Lead Status, and click Save. We cover a couple other ways to do it in the next unit. 

# Convert Leads to Opportunities, Accounts, and Contacts

  1. Qualifying a lead indicates that you believe the lead has a use for and interest in your products, and that a sale is a definite possibility.

  2. Some businesses choose to qualify leads more quickly than others. 

  3. The exact criteria for qualifying and converting leads are part of your company’s unique business process.

  4. When you qualify a lead, you can convert the lead record into an opportunity. You then work your opportunity until you close the deal either by completing it or canceling it.

  5. When you convert a lead, Salesforce uses the information stored in the lead record to create a business account, a contact, and an opportunity
