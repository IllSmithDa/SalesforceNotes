# Salesforce 
  1. Customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers.
  2. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud.
    * If your data is stored in spreadsheets, hidden in emails or text messages, or pinned to your bulletin board, it’s hard to get the full picture of your prospective customer.
