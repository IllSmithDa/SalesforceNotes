# Understanding Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic

  1. Lightning Experience is a modern user interface that helps your sales reps sell faster and your service reps support customers more productively. 
  
  2. Lightning Experience includes many new features and entirely redesigned pages, but not every Salesforce feature is supported in Lightning Experience.

  3. So the Salesforce experience you’ve known to date—called Salesforce Classic—is still available for you, and the users you enable for Lightning Experience can switch between the two at will.

# Comparing Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic

  1. Home - An intelligent page filled with insights, a slick performance chart, and a helpful assistant feature, highlighting what’s most important each day.

    * In Lightning Experience, Home show events remaining on a user's calendar today. Users can access all their events from the Calendar tab in the navigation bar.

  2. Accounts and Contacts - Sales and service reps get a layout designed to help them find the information they need, fast.

  3. Opportunities and Leads - Sales reps in Lightning Experience find a turbo-charged workspace for managing opportunities and leads. View related information in the Quick View. Create tasks and events, log calls, and send emails, and track all those activities in the Activity Timeline.

  4. Kanban View - Sales reps can use the Kanban view, a visualization tool, to review deals organized by each stage in the pipeline. With drag-and-drop functionality, sales reps can move deals from one stage to another, and get personalized alerts on key deals in flight. 
  
    * Kanban is available on opportunities, leads, tasks, and many other objects.

  5. Reports

    * Sales and service reps who use reports find an improved user interface, including the ability to easily create filters and add enhanced charts.

    * And Salesforce admins find features on the dashboard editor, including flexible layouts and spanning columns. However, some report features aren’t yet available in Lightning Experience, including feeds and scheduled reports.

  6. List Views

    * List Views have gotten an upgrade in Lightning Experience, including some super new stuff like the ability to create a quick chart from a list view or add filters with an improved, easy-to-use interface.

  7. Custom JavaScript Buttons

    * Custom buttons and links that use a JavaScript content source aren’t supported in Lightning Experience. Check out these resources for migrating your JavaScript custom button and link functionality to Lightning-friendly options.

  8. AppExchange Apps with Custom Objects, Visualforce Pages, and More

    * Many apps from the AppExchange feature customizations, including custom objects, custom buttons, Visualforce pages, and more. Salesforce partners are testing their apps in Lightning Experience and applying for Lightning Ready certification. 

    * Apps that are Lightning Ready work in Lightning Experience and offer a more consistent experience with other Lightning Pages.

    * If an app is supported in Lightning Experience, a Lightning Ready sash appears on its AppExchange listing. If an app isn’t supported in Lightning Experience, use it in Salesforce Classic instead.

# Evaluate Your Org with the Lightning Experience Readiness Check

  1. To evaluate whether some of the key features and customizations you’ve implemented in Salesforce Classic are ready for Lightning Experience, kick off the Lightning Experience Readiness Check. That way, you can learn which are ready now for Lightning Experience and which may need your attention before you switch over all your users.

  2. You’ll get a personalized Readiness Report, with an assessment of the features and customizations evaluated by the Readiness Check and recommendations on your next steps. 

  3. From Setup in Salesforce Classic, click Get Started in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant tile at the top of the menu (1).

  4. Select the Discover phase (2).

  5. Click Evaluate Lightning Experience Benefits and Readiness to expand the stage (3).

  6. Click Check Readiness next to Check your Lightning Experience readiness (4).

# Preview Your Org in Lightning Experience

  2. From Setup in Salesforce Classic, click Get Started in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant tile at the top of the menu (1).

  3. Select the Discover phase (2).

  4. Click Evaluate Lightning Experience Benefits and Readiness to expand the stage (3).

# Decide Who Can Use Lightning Experience

  1. Want to test Lightning Experience with a small group of custom profile users but you don’t want to turn it on for everyone assigned to these profiles? 
  
    * Create a permission set that includes the Lightning Experience User permission. Then apply the permission set to each pilot user. When you turn on Lightning Experience, only pilot users see the new interface.

  2. Interested in rolling out Lightning Experience to everyone assigned to specific custom profiles? Or ready to enable all your custom profile users? 

    * Adding the Lightning Experience User permission to profiles is the fastest way to mass-enable the new user interface.

  3. After Lightning Experience is turned on, things change. From this point, when users are assigned the Lightning Experience User permission, they get Lightning Experience by default. 

# Other cool Stuff about LIghtning 

  1. You can personalize your navigation bar

    * Reorder tabs and items

    * You can add more items to the navigation bar by clicing Add More Items

    * Users can’t remove the items you include in the navigation bar, and they can’t personalize the navigation bar when it contains more than 50 items.

    * Items that you add to an app’s navigation bar are added to the end of users’ personalized navigation bars in the order that you added them.

    * When you remove an item from an app, that item remains in your users’ personalized navigation bars, and users can then delete it.

    * If you don’t want your users to personalize the navigation bar for any app, disable personalization. From Setup, enter User Interface in the Quick Find box, then select User Interface. Select Disable Navigation Bar Personalization in Lightning Experience. Salesforce recommends disabling navigation personalization by app instead of for the entire org.

    * Control if temporary tabs are created when users access items outside of the app. From Setup in Lightning Experience, go to the App Manager. Edit the desired app. On the App Options page, select Disable temporary tabs for items outside of this app.

    * The tab’s dropdown menu includes an option to create an item. For example, create an account by selecting + New Account from the Account tab’s dropdown menu. However, the New action doesn’t appear if:

      - Users don’t have the create permission for the object

      - The New action isn’t part of the search layout for the object’s list view
