# Three Key Account and Contact Relationships

  1. There are three specific types of relationships between people and the accounts that you’re tracking, each of which offers a different view into the complexities of business relationships.

    *  Relationships between companies (accounts) and the people who work at them (contacts). 

      - The Contacts to Multiple Accounts feature lets you relate a contact to more than one account, so you can track the relationships between people and the companies they work with. 

      - Seeing who has an indirect relationship with Get Cloudy might help move the deal forward.

    * Relationships between your customers (accounts) and other customers (other accounts).

      - The Account Hierarchy lets you see what companies Get Cloudy is affiliated with. Perhaps they have a parent company that you’ve already done business with.

    * Relationships between customers (accounts) and coworkers who deal with them (other Salesforce users).

      - Finally, Account Teams tell you which sales reps are working on the Get Cloudy deal so you can better coordinate with your internal team.

  2. Accounts can only have on owner

# Contacts to Multiple Accounts

  1. When you relate a single contact to multiple accounts, you can easily track the relationships between people and businesses without creating duplicate records.

  2. The relationship rules are still simple. Every contact needs to be directly associated with an account. This is the account that appears in Account Name and is usually the company the contact is most closely associated with.

  3. Any other accounts associated with the contact represent indirect relationships. The Related Contacts list view lets you view current and past relationships, and capture unique and custom details about these relationships so you always know who you’re talking to—or who you should be talking to.

  4. Mark primary relationship to an Account using Direct and others markex as indirect. You can even switch relationship status from active to inactive and even a relationship end date

# Account Hierarchies

  1. To view an account’s hierarchy, click the Accounts tab and select an account. Click the View Hierarchy link next to the Account Name field.

# You have two basic choices when you’re deciding how to establish accounts for businesses with multiple locations. 

  1. Global Enterprise Account

    * You could establish one global account and link all contacts, opportunities, cases, and so on to that single overarching account. 

    * Using one global account makes it easy to find that account’s records and to report on that account at the enterprise level. 

    * But it’s harder to manage a large mass of information, and not being able to easily view the big picture might make it hard to see what each location needs from you for your relationship to be successful. 

  2. Location-Specific Accounts

    * Establish accounts for each location and create contacts, opportunities, cases, and so on separately for each location.

    * With this option, you maintain more accounts and need to set up a few more complex reports to get the big picture.

    * But using multiple accounts means you can take advantage of account ownership, hierarchies, specific sharing settings, and more granular reporting. 

    * You can also more easily track and report on opportunities, cases, and other interactions for each account.

    * We recommend establishing accounts for each separate location, rather than squeezing all locations into a single global account. 

      - This arrangement lets you concentrate on customer success in each location while still giving you the ability to put the big picture together.

# Account Teams

  1. Unless your company is teeny tiny, it’s likely that more than one person works with each account. For example, the team of employees for an account might include a sales rep, sales manager, support agent, support manager, and marketing personnel. You set up the sales team for accounts you own.

  2. With account teams, you can enable the appropriate access to different account roles. Each person on an account team can be assigned different roles and different levels of access to the account and its opportunities and cases. 

    * For example, the support agent can see and edit cases tied to the account. 
    
  3. The Account Teams feature isn’t set up automatically. An administrator must turn it on and set up the roles that each team member can be assigned.

  4. To make account teams faster to use, you can set up your own personal Default Account Team in your personal settings. Default Teams are a shortcut that saves you from having to enter the same members into the same form over and over again. 

  5. If the same people usually work together, create a default account team and assign them to it. Then, add the entire default team to your account by selecting Add Default Team from the Account Team related list action menu.
