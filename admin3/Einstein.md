# AI Basics and Smart Assistants

  1. At a high level, AI is the concept of having “machines think like humans.” You’re starting to see examples of AI in your everyday life because we’re at an evolutionary tipping point. AI isn’t a new concept—we’ve had the theoretical models for a long time—but it’s finally possible thanks to the access and increase in large amounts of data combined with the low cost of high-power computing.

    * e.g The turing test

  2. AI has benefits for all parts of the business. 

    * The AI assistant would know who the customer is, their historical banking activity, and the best way to answer their question based on past inquiries. 

    * Customers get their questions answered quickly, in a self-service manner with fewer touchpoints

    * Support agents get more time back in their day, allowing them to provide 1:1 customer support for top tier accounts

    * Customers are happier, and happy customers = higher revenue retention = more money for the bank

    * Sales reps no longer have to enter sales data manually. Marketers no longer have to use manual A/B testing to select the best social media images for their next campaign. And customer service managers no longer have to sift through long lists of incoming service calls to prioritize their time.

    * Machine learning is the core driver of AI. It’s the process of using algorithms to tell you something interesting about your data without writing code specific to the problem you’re trying to solve.

      - Said differently, it’s a way to have computers learn from data with minimal programming. 

    *  Deep learning is great at automatically learning the best features from somewhat noisy data (read: unstructured) so that algorithms can learn more effectively. It also:

      - Uses complex algorithms to perform tasks in domains where it actually learns the domain with little or no human supervision.

      - Learns how to learn. For example, consumer apps like Google use deep learning to power facial recognition in photos.
