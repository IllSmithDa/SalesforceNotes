# Activities

  1. When we create a custom object, there is an object to allow activities 

    * Two things happen

      - related list: open activities - made up of task and email (workflow rules) 

      - related list: activity history - log all your past activities here

  2. Activity history

    * Options include log a call, mail merge, send an email
 
  3. Open activiies 

    * Tasks and Events in the open activities have a polymorphic relationship 

      - same object can be related to multiple objects, but only one at a time

      - Student Mark - student master : relationship field to represent this relationship

      - Student mark - account : relationship field to represent this relationship

    * All your tasks can be also seen from your primary home page 

# Task vs Event 

  1. Both are considered activities 

  2. Tasks have a due date and action while Events don't 

  3. An event is a blocked-off period of time on your calendar, whereas a task is just an item on a checklist with a specific due date.

  4. Events are things like a 10:00am meeting with a co-worker or a noon lunch appointment with a client.

  5. A task is usually a more discrete to-do itemâ€”for example, a common task is to follow up with a Lead by calling a contact/company to continue conversation or move them through your pipeline. A task could also be something like running an errand or filling out your time sheet.
