# Develop an AppExchange Strategy

  1. Listing type — Are you looking for something that plugs into Salesforce without much fuss? If yes, a solution, like a Lightning component, is probably your best bet. Or do you want help building a custom solution for a complex business problem? In that case, a consulting service is the better fit.

  2. Functionality - What does the solution need to do? Which of these features are must-haves and which are nice-to-haves?

  3. Budget - Are you open to paying for the right solution, or does it need to be free? For paid listings, what is your preferred pricing model? AppExchange supports both onetime payments and subscriptions.

  4. Stakeholder needs - Who is using the solution? Make sure that you meet with these stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and timelines.

  5. Testing - Do you have somewhere you can test everything first? Before installing a solution in a production org, we always recommend testing in a Developer Edition org or a sandbox.

  6. Technical consideration - Does the solution need to be compatible with a specific Salesforce edition or feature? What about Lightning Experience or the Salesforce app? Think about what’s unique to your org, and take note of those items.

  7.  Logging in levels up your AppExchange experience by personalizing the home page for how you use Salesforce. After you log in, we show you listing suggestions from Appy, your expert guide to AppExchange. Appy’s suggestions are based on your role, the industry you work in, and other aspects of your Salesforce experience. The more you use AppExchange, the better the suggestions get. 

# Navigate the Home page

  1. Search bar -  Just plug in keywords from your strategy and let AppExchange do the heavy lifting.

  2. Listings by Type - If you’re in the mood to browse, the Listings by Type category lets you narrow your focus to specific types of solutions, like apps.
    
    *  Within a listing type, you can filter by price, rating, and other criteria to refine listings based on your requirements.

  3. Product and Industry Collections - The Product Collections category organizes listings according to Salesforce product, like Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud.

    * Likewise, the Industry Collections category lets you view listings by major industry, like Healthcare & Life Sciences.
  
# View Listings 

  1. Listing summary section 

    * Provides images and videos, along with key listing details like price and average rating.

  2. Listing actions bar

    * Lets you save the listing to the favorites list in your AppExchange profile, or learn more about it via demos and test drives. 

    * For solutions, the actions bar is also where you go to start the installation process.

  3. Overview tab

    * Provides a longer description of the solution or service, the provider’s contact information, and links to documentation, such as case studies. 

    *  For solutions, you can also view details about the package, including type and contents.

  4. Reviews tab 

    * Displays ratings and feedback from Salesforce community members, including the top positive and critical reviews

# How to Try Listings 

  1. Test Drive

    * A test drive lets you experience the solution in a read-only Developer Edition org configured by the provider.

    * You receive login credentials and can explore functionality in the org using sample data. 

  2. Free Trial

    * A free trial lets you experience the solution in a writable Developer Edition org for a limited time period. 

    * Similar to a test drive, a free trial is configured with sample data.

    * Unlike a test drive, you can customize the org and continue using it if you decide to buy. To see if a free trial is available, click Get It Now and look for the option to install in a trial org (2).

# How to Install Offerings

  1. Am I installing the package in the right org? 

    * AppExchange Superheroes never install in production without testing in a Developer Edition org or a sandbox first. 

    * When you’ve decided where to install the package, have the login credentials for that org available. You need those credentials to establish a connection with AppExchange.

  2. Have I reviewed the provider’s documentation? 
  
    * Many listings include documentation to help you with installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. If documentation is available, it appears on the Overview tab.

  3. Who needs access to the offering?

    * When you install a package, you determine which users can access its functionality

    * Options include admins only, all users, or specific profiles. If you’re not sure, grant access to admins only—you can always give other users access later.
