# Quick Actions

  1. With custom quick actions, you can make your users’ navigation and workflow as smooth as possible by giving them convenient access to information that’s most important.

  2. Quick actions can also invoke Lightning components, flows, Visualforce pages, or canvas apps with functionality that you define. 

  3. Create quick actions, and add them to your Salesforce Classic home page, to the Chatter tab, to Chatter groups, and to record detail pages.

# Object-specific quick actions

  1. Object-specific actions have automatic relationships to other records. Users can quickly create or update records, log calls, send emails, and more in the context of a particular object.

# Global quick actions
  
  1. You create global quick actions in a different place in Setup than object-specific actions. They’re called global actions because they can be put anywhere actions are supported. Users can log call details, create or update records, or send email, all without leaving the page they’re on.

  2. Go to Setup, Global actions to start creating actions for your various objects. Then assign it to a object's page layout the quick action section. 

    * For custom, go to custom buttons and links and Actions and create the global custom action there. Then assign it to any object's page layout particularly the quick action section.
