# Importing Records from an External system (Excel for example)

  1. External IDs prevent the creation of dupilcate records as a result of importing data

    * Salesforce will check to see if the External ID you have provide already exist in the system

  2. It will abort operations where duplicate records exists 

  3. What kind of fields be set up as a external ID

# Tools for importing data 

  1. Data import Wizard 

    * It only supports standard objects and custom object not including opportunity

    * supports 50000 records at a time

    * You can only import records is possible but data duplication is still prevented

    * You also have to the option to turn off workflow and process builder rules


  2. Data loader 

    * Supports all objects including custom objects except the User object

    * Supports both import and export 

    * 50 million records supported 

    * Uses all csv files

    * drag and drop field mapping 

# Data Export 

  1. Data Export lets you prepare a copy of all your data in salesforce.com. From this page you can start the export process manually or schedule it to run automatically. 
  
    * When an export is ready for download you will receive an email containing a link that allows you to download the file(s). The export files are also available on this page for 48 hours, after which time they are deleted.

    * The last line of strings in the url represents the record ID

# Data Import 

  1. Go to your personal settings to reset your security token which will then be set to your email

  2. When importing data using external source such as a excel file, you do not need to provide record ID as that will be auto generated by Salesforce. 

  3. The external ID is set up through Salesforce 

  4. Any field (usually being ID type) that is autogenerated by Salesforce do not need to be added in Excel docs or any external source. 

  4. Data loader will allow you either delete or hard delete a record. 

    * Delete is a temporary delete where it sits in recycle bin for 15 days which allows for restoration

    * Hard delete permenantly deletes a record with no chance to restore the record

    * Salesforce has a recycle bin which stores soft deleted records

    * In fact, many of the standard fields will be autogenerated by Salesforce including created Data.

    * Custom fields can also be deleted if they are autogenerated through a formula field

    * Other fields you can delete from external source are fields generated by updated by either work flows and approval process

  5. Picklists and Data loader 

    * If you enter in the external source, any value that is not in the picklist in Salesforce, the system will not detect it and you will be avle to successfully to insert them'

      - They will however be put on the inactive list and you will have to activate them in the object settings 

  6. Owner and and created by in the record will be set to whoever logged in to the Salesforce data loader when importing the data

  7. All new records created through the data loader will all follow the workflow rules as well any existing approval process including any email alerts that go with them. 

  8. Data loader also has a upsert option which basically allows you to create and update data. 

    * If data already exists, system will try to perform a update and if data does not exist, system will try to perform 'create'

    * This is determined by whether the record ID is present and the External ID is unique.

      - no record ID and different External ID will be seen as a new entry 

      - if record ID is present and same external ID, system will attempt update

  9. If you have to insert a new record for a master detail relationship that has not been established
    
    * Get the record ID of parent record and establish relationship wth child

  10. Export vs Export all

    * export all includes records in the recycle bin

    * export only includes the active records

# Data Mangement 

  1. Good data vs bad data 

    * data to disregard and data to regard

  2. Bad Data

    * non relative value

    * numbers without units

    * values that represent the same thing

    * use validation rules to handle potential bad data 

      - also consider using picklist with predefined values

      - automated rules

  3. App Exchange 

    * Serveral apps for data cleansing 

      - Dupecatcher 

      - Addresstools

    * Good for any out of the box functionality
