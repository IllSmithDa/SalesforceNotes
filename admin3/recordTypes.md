# How to control which fields are displayed depending on value of other fields

  1. You have to obviously have the fields first 

  2. You use page layout settings and record type to do this

  3. You first create 2 different layouts form the original layout which reflect which fields you wish to display based on other field values 

  4. In Object settings, go Record Types and after naming, apply desired layout 

    * You can map different page layout based on different profiles

    * Create the different layout types as needed

  5. In Page Layout, Go to Page Layout Assignments 

    * Here you can again show different record types to different profiles 

  6. Now when you create a new record, it will give you at least the two different record type options. 

  7. Useful when you have two different record types or two different sets of needs but they share the same Object type or step in the process. 

    * e.g software salesman and hardware salesman have different sets of record needs but both are in Opportunity stage

# More on record types

  1. You can assign different record types with different page layouts with fields 

    * You can set them by groups, user, object, or profiles 

      - each of these can be assigned different layout or different version of the same object and tab

      - these different versions (layouts) can and most likely will have different fields
