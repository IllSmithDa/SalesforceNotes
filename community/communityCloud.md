# CRM and Salesforce Overview

  1. A community is a group of people who share a common mission or goal

  2. Use community to generate ideas for new products or test prototypes in a safe space, log support tickets, provide live chat with agents or sell products

  3. Create multiple opportunities within your salesfroce org to address different pueposes and many compaonies do just that 

  4. Communities live in your Salesforce org. You can choose which members from your company which customers, partners or other people outside your compnay can participate

# License Model 
 
  1. You can go from limited license to a more unlimited lincense but not the other way around 

  2. Salesforce only makes you pay for the licenses you use rather than total avilable to your org

  3. Customer Community 

    * Standard option with no access to reports, dashboard, opportunities or campaign

  4. Much cheaper with only about 25 percent of the cost of a full salesforce license

  5. You assign a license to a community user as well as profile and it will create a contact as well as a Account in which all community user will be listed under that the Account community.
