# Aura 

  1. Allows developers to create responsive ui and responsive web design

  2. Aura was originally meant for mobile ui and then extended to desktop as Lightning

  3. If you develop a lightning app, it does not mean you can see it in classic

    * However, classic apps will be veiwable and usable in Lightning

# lightning

  1. Allows you to set favorites on any objects

  2. You can go to App Manager and set a 'Show in Lightning' setting for any app developed in classic but you are not able to see in Lightning.

  3. Classic does not support Lightning Component and so Lightning Apps will not be able to see Classic Salesforce

# Mobile Lightning

  1. To start Lightning mobile app, find Salesforce Mobile Quick Start 

  2. This will create the mobile version of your organization 

    * Also do things like security settings, branding, navigation menu, page layouts, actions, etc. 

  3. Compact layout - creates custom layout and key fields that are specifically designed for the mobile version of the app

    * Mobile phones viewport is limited so showing all the fields is not very good idea. 

      - Too many tabs will make the app messy and difficult to navigate for users
