# Mobile is about micro elements 

  * Unlike the long sit-down sessions that are common with laptops, people interact with their phones in a series of brief and frequent bursts.

  * Generally they’re trying to accomplish a specific task—like getting directions or checking their calendar—and they don’t have much time to do it before getting pulled away or distracted.

  * Short: The interaction is brief. The time it takes to complete is no longer than a minute and a half.

  * Atomic: The interaction is discrete and focused. It’s one workflow or activity, and the interaction isn’t dependent on other things. It doesn’t require users to jump outside of their flow to go complete another action somewhere else.

  * Contextual: The interaction happens in real-time, and it’s related to the user’s current situation. What’s the user doing now? What does she need? Where is she? What’s next on her calendar?

  * Involve users early and explore their needs

  * On the horizontal axis is ease of cultural adoption. Evaluate each use case and decide how much work it will be to change your users’ existing behavior.

  * On the vertical axis is business impact. Rank each use case according to how much value it will add to your business.

  * You’ll learn the most about your users by doing a ride-along. There’s really no substitute for witnessing your user’s successes and struggles firsthand.

  * Make sure to always identify key stakeholders and super users for successful rollout and educate your company about your app.

# Finalizing Mobile App

  1. Less is more. For your page layouts, consider the screen size of mobile devices and move the most important information to the top. Only add the fields that are truly necessary.

  2. Build for speed. Think about performance when adding custom elements to your pages. Are there images or processes that can cause slower page load times?

  3. Think about tap targets. Consider how users interact with their mobile devices when creating custom pages. For example, buttons are easier to tap than links.

  4. Embrace mobile capabilities. Think about all the cool features available on our phones: location detection, camera, accelerometer, and more. 

# Optimize Your Visualforce Pages
 
  1. If you have existing Visualforce pages, it’s possible to make them available to mobile users in the Salesforce app. You can just check a box to enable a Visualforce page for mobile. 

  2. Visualforce pages aren’t automatically mobile-friendly in the mobile app, and when you’re testing, you can have some issues with your existing pages and custom apps.

    * Fortunately, making your Visualforce pages look great in the mobile app is relatively straightforward. You can either revise your code so that your pages work in the full Salesforce site and the Salesforce app, or you can create mobile-specific pages.

# Test your Customizations 

  1. Once you’ve finished your setup tasks, you’ve reached a huge mobile milestone—you have a prototype of your own customized version of the Salesforce app.

  2. Be sure to test the app on every type of mobile device and every operating system your employees use to access the Salesforce app. 

  3. Before your official mobile launch, you should pilot the app with a small group of users to get early feedback.

# Security

  1. he Salesforce app provides enterprise-grade security right out of the box. You can control policies like session timeouts, PIN code enforcement, offline data storage, IP white lists, and many other settings using Connected App Policies. 

  2. You can also use the Salesforce app in combination with Mobile Device Management (MDM), also known as Mobile Enterprise Management (MEM). These tools help you manage BYOD policies, provision devices with pre-installed apps, push enterprise identity certificates, install VPN profiles, monitor traffic, and direct access to an enterprise app store.

  3. Single Sign-On

    * If your employees currently access the full Salesforce site using single sign-on, you probably need to make some changes in order for it to work properly with the mobile app

# Before You Launch

  1. Migrate, then test. If you migrated your mobile customizations from your sandbox to your production environment, test everything again to make sure the Salesforce app is working as expected.

  2. Control access. By default, all users have access to the Salesforce app. If you’re doing a phased rollout, define which employees can use the mobile app during this stage of your rollout. See the Salesforce Mobile App Security and Compliance module for details.

  3. Collect a baseline. Take an analytic snapshot of the metrics your company is using to define success. Then you can use that data as a baseline for measuring the business impact of your rollout.

  4. Take it to Chatter. Create a public, company-wide Chatter group where your users can ask questions about the mobile app and access training materials. Make sure your super users are engaged and ready to swarm on the questions that get posted in the group.

# Enable Salesforce Adoption Manager

  1. Another great way to boost your organization’s mobile adoption is to use Adoption Manager. We turned this off during our pilot, but now’s the time for it to shine. Adoption Manager has a proven track record of success when it comes to driving adoption.

  2. To re-enable Adoption Manager, go to Setup in the full Salesforce site. Enter Adoption in the Quick Find box, select Adoption Manager, and then select Enable Salesforce Adoption Manager.

# Post Launch

  1. After you go live with the Salesforce app, it’s important to collect feedback about overall satisfaction and any pain points. Make it a priority to listen to your users. 

  2. When you were planning your rollout strategy, you worked with your executive sponsor and stakeholders to determine your success metrics. Now that you’ve rolled out the Salesforce app, it’s time to review your metrics and figure out exactly how you want to measure them.
  
  3. If your metrics include employee satisfaction, you can gather data using some of the methods we already discussed, like surveys, forums, and polls. 

  4. Your executive sponsor has been your project champion from the start. Now it’s time to prepare a summary for them on the overall project status and any results you’re able to share. Include soundbites they can use to showcase return on investment (ROI) for the resources that they allocated for this project.
