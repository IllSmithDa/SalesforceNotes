# Jira 

  * All about getting organized  


# Product Backlog 
  
  * list of requirements by business values

  * non functional requirements where non business requirements is focused

# Grooming Section and Sprint Planning meeting

  * Meeting to know how much it commit to deliver by the end of the sprint 

    - Grooming process is tine tuning the requirement to accurately and more clearly define the criterias of what we need to implement the feature

    - Find out what you are missing when discussing requirements to gain clarity

    - asking all the relevant questions now so you don't get blocked during development

    - grooming can also trigger new requirements as people come up with new ideas

  * Having an accurate estimate is important as it as business implications what you are able to deliver to production

  * Story points 

    - Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. 

    - When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant.

    - e.g We estimate as a team, we can deliver 15 story points in 2 weeks or 1 sprint. Its not individuals but as a team. 

    - If a project requires 51 points, it has a minimum estimate of 6 weeks or 3 sprints. 

    - THe higher the number, higher the risk and so best practice story point should not be more than 5

    - If it is, break it up to make it different pieces less than 5 points which you can assign to multiple people

    - Epic is way to group the issues in Jira

    - gro

  * Assigning tasks to the appropriate people will also happen here. 

# Sprint

  * 2 Weeks timeline picked up from backlog

  * implementation of a couple of features 

  * daily standups to make sure everything is on and not blocked

    - If a developer is blocked, it is then flagged and developer moves onto a new task from the backlog
  
  * In Jira, you move the prints from To do, to In progress and finally completed 

  * add more in columns as you go during the sprint 

# Sprint Review 

  * review and demo product and ship what is good

    - stakeholders should be involved in the demo 

    - visualize what is working and even get ideas to add for backlog especially ideas that may have initially missed

  * Jira tracks how many points you have commited, and how many you actually completed 

  * Velocity is how many points you have completetd during a single sprint 

    - Good practice is to never commit more story points than your average sprint velocity

  * Hours

    - Hours is the classic model where instead of points, work is estimated by the amount of hours
     
    - story points tend to be more accurate than hours

  * Goal here is not perfection but instead to deliver value

    - Under promise but over delivering is ideal

# Sprint Retrospective 

  * reviewing the entirety of the process 

  * looking back the sprint 

  * As a team, you become more efficient and you spend less time grooming, and more time development

    - e.g 30 min to 5 min in grooming.

    - goal for agile development in Jira

    - collective knowledge of what everyone understands

    - 100 percent clarity is always the goal though it may not always to possible

  * Story points are often very different individuals and teams 

  * This is how developers stay productive and organized 

  * Practicing Jira is important to be able to do in a live environment

  * When you deliver value it should be matched by what the customer wanted and expected
