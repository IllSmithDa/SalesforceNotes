# Lightning development

  1. Out of the box component sets available out of the box 

  2. Component based ecosytem

  3. Lightning components can be downloaded from app exchange

  4. Lightning compnents are based on javascript with stateful client and stateless server. 
  
    * Stateful means that the server stores some session information to identify a user over multiple subsequent requests. If the session is valid, the requests would succeed.

    * In stateless the server would not store any state, that is session information to identify the user over multiple subsequent requests. 
    
    * Each request should include some way of identifying the user.â€©A stateful server remembers client data (state) from one request to the next. A stateless server keeps no state information.

  5. Most common stateless architecture that uses the HTTP is REST (REpresentational State Transfer) which is used to design web APIs

  6. Lightning component framework can be used to create highly scalable UI framework for developing web applications for mobile and desktop

  7. Two types of events supported by lightning is component event and application event.
